                <p class="article-p">The gameplay is very similar to its predecessors in that the player controls a
                    number of heroes that command
                    an army of creatures inspired by myth and legend. The gameplay is divided into two parts, tactical
                    overland
                    exploration and a turn-based combat system. The player creates an army by spending resources at one
                    of the eight town types in the game. The hero progresses in experience by engaging in combat with
                    enemy heroes and monsters... </p>
