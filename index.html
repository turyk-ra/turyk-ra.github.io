                Might & Magic 3,
                or Heroes 3, or abbreviated <span>HoMM 3</span>) is a turn-based strategy game developed by Jon Van

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>

            <img class="article-images" id="gameplay-world-map"
                src="./resources/images/Heroes_III_(карта_приключений).jpg" alt="">
            <figcaption>
                <p class="figcaption-description">World Map</p>
            </figcaption>
            <p class="article-p">The gameplay is very similar to its predecessors in that the player controls a number
                of heroes that
                command
                an army of creatures inspired by myth and legend. The gameplay is divided into two parts, tactical
                overland
                exploration and a turn-based combat system. The player creates an army by spending resources at one of
                the
                eight town types in the game. The hero progresses in experience by engaging in combat with enemy heroes
                and
                monsters. The conditions for victory vary depending on the map, including conquest of all enemies and
                towns,
                collection of a certain amount of a resource, or finding the grail artifact. If a player loses all of
                their
                towns they will have seven game days to capture a new town. If they fail to do so they lose and the game
                ends. If a player loses all their heroes and towns, they will lose the game.</p>

            <p class="article-p">Two official expansion packs were released for Heroes III. The first of these
                expansions, Armageddon's
                Blade,
                introduced a ninth town alignment, the Conflux; a random scenario generator, a variety of new creatures,
                heroes, and structures; and six new playable campaigns.

                The second expansion, The Shadow of Death, was a stand-alone expansion that included Restoration of
                Erathia
                and added seven new playable campaigns and a variety of new artifacts, including Combination Artifacts.
                Combination Artifacts were extremely powerful items assembled by collecting a specific set of lesser
                artifacts.</p>
