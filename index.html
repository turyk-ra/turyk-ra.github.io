        <h2>About Heroes</h2>
        <p><span>Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia</span> (commonly referred to as Heroes of Might & Magic 3,
            or Heroes 3, or abbreviated <span>HoMM 3</span>) is a turn-based strategy game developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New
            World Computing originally released for Microsoft Windows by The 3DO Company in 1999. Its ports to several
            computer and console systems followed in 1999â€“2000. It is the third installment of the Heroes of Might and
            Magic series.</p>
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>The gameplay is very similar to its predecessors in that the player controls a number of heroes that command
            an army of creatures inspired by myth and legend. The gameplay is divided into two parts, tactical overland
            exploration and a turn-based combat system. The player creates an army by spending resources at one of the
            eight town types in the game. The hero progresses in experience by engaging in combat with enemy heroes and
            monsters. The conditions for victory vary depending on the map, including conquest of all enemies and towns,
            collection of a certain amount of a resource, or finding the grail artifact. If a player loses all of their
            towns they will have seven game days to capture a new town. If they fail to do so they lose and the game
            ends. If a player loses all their heroes and towns, they will lose the game.</p>
        <h2>Expansion packs</h2>
        <p>Two official expansion packs were released for Heroes III. The first of these expansions, Armageddon's Blade,
            introduced a ninth town alignment,[7] the Conflux; a random scenario generator, a variety of new creatures,
            heroes, and structures; and six new playable campaigns.

            The second expansion, The Shadow of Death, was a stand-alone expansion that included Restoration of Erathia
            and added seven new playable campaigns and a variety of new artifacts, including Combination Artifacts.
            Combination Artifacts were extremely powerful items assembled by collecting a specific set of lesser
            artifacts.</p>
        <h2>Unofficial releases</h2>
        <p>A fan-made expansion, In the Wake of Gods (also titled Heroes 3.5), was released in 2001. It adds new
            creatures, including eighth level creatures and "God's representatives", which give bonus to heroes' primary
            skills. Heroes can also destroy and rebuild towns.[8]

            Horn of the Abyss, a second fan-made expansion, was announced in 2008 and released on December 31, 2011. It
            adds a new town type, a large number of new items to put on maps, new playable campaigns, a graphical random
            map generator template editor, among other features.[9][10]

            VCMI is an open source implementation of the engine for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS.[11] It
            offers higher resolutions and extensive mod support.</p>
